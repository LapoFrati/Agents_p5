# NeuroEvolution with p5.js and tf.js

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/LapoFrati/NeuroEvo_p5.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/LapoFrati/NeuroEvo_p5)

Isn't it nice when you can see the creatures you have created live peacefully in their own digital environment? Running complex simulations sure is rewarding but seeing the results in a huge CSV is not as satisfying as seeing the agents wander around. Making a nice looking real-time visualization of the simulation is usually not an easy task. Luckily P5.js comes to the rescue by providing some simple to use graphic primitives.

The project has been inspired by the amazing tutorials of Daniel Shiffman from which much of the code upon which this project is built has been borrowed.

But what is this project about? Evolving agents. Simple, eh? Not? What is that do you ask? Well, the agent part is pretty straightforward, they are "entities" that do "stuff", pieces of code in this specific case, that change some variables they have been allowed to change. And where do the evolution part comes in? Easy, that's how they "choose" what variables to change. I'm quoting the choosing part since we might debate endlessly if there is any real choice involved here. But that's not the point. The point is that it's both interesting to experiment with and pleasant to look at.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```javascript
let var = 4;
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```
